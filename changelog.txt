NOTES:
Low Memory Mode is a low priority for me because it's a separate codebase so adding features is hard.
Also, the regular mode can now run on 6 GB easily, and even 4 GB if all other GPU apps are closed.
Apart from that, it's now possible to run the regular mode on CPU, which is slow, but it works.
